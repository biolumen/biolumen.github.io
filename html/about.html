					About
					<br>
					<p> BIOLUMEN comes from the Greek word "bios" and the Latin word "lumen" which means "lifelight". It is a website orignally created to be a submission for the Future Ready Asean Competition 2019. It was created by Racquel Alyssa F. Catolico and Filbert Joseph A. Ubanos, two scholars from Philippine Science High School - Main Campus. This website aims to shed light on the problems that plague the biodiversity of the world and the ASEAN Region specifically, in hopes of becoming a platform for people to know more and act. </p>

						Filbert Joseph A. Ubanos
						<br>
						I am a Philippine Science High School scholar residing currently in Quezon City, Philippines! Some of my hobbies include reading, studying, eating (especially chicken wings and ramen noodles), playing video games on various forms and trying my hardest to be a healthy and happy person who is capable of being fit and a prominent role in the preservation of the beauty of life in our planet. I love the ideas of not giving up and trying to be physically and mentally fit, so I like motivation things and being motivational myself. I was in charge of making most of the content of this website, as well as helping my partner with some of the other intricacies of the code of the website. My wish is for this website to be a cornerstone in the preservation of life that is so beautiful and that I can be a model for change. I am also one of the founder of Biolumen.

						Hello! I am Celver Ortiz from PSHS - MC, as of now my life has been full of studying and school works and sleeping has been one of the things I do to keep my energy up and survive from the overwhelming requirements, but how can you sleep if you know that the place where you sleep on is undergoing destruction which was caused by your species. That is why I helped making Biolumen, a major tool for spreading awareness with what is happening on our lovely planet especially with the generation revolving around social media and technology.

						Hi! My name is Mark Justine Montiero from PSHS Main Campus. When I was a child, I have always been curious about many aspects about our world which is why I have always been interested in Science, especially Biology. I  loved learning about all of the different Flora and Fauna around the world, which is why I felt devastated knowing that many of the species in our world are on the brink of extinction. This is why I helped create Biolumen to spread awareness throughout the world about Earth's biodiversity and how it is being ruined by many of humanity's actions.

						Racquel Alyssa F. Catolico
						<br> 
						Hi! I'm Racquel Catolico, a passionate artist from Philippine Science High School Main Campus, and I am in charge of the design and most of the code in the blog website. I've always wanted to learn more about the things happening in the environment and atmosphere around us and I try my best to interpret the negative situations and challenges and voice out different opinions from the people through art. Drawing and painting are also my driving forces to help me to do better and to improve myself as a whole. Although the design aspect of the website may not be the most important factor in this case, I want to show that no matter how good the content is, the website won't be easy to read without well thought-out web design. I am also a founder of Biolumen.

						Sidney Lance C. Fernando
						<br>
						Hi! I'm Sidney, a South kid who's been studying here in Pisay. I love reading (mostly fiction books), playing guitar, listening to music, occasionally making art, and of course--I love the earth. I try to do my part in helping fight environmental problems through everyday actions, and I think these everyday things we do really do play a great part in either saving or destroying our planet. For our blog, I did a portion of the research and articles.
